Vanilla Tweaks is a small mod that changes and rebalances some things from Terraria.
Changes include:
 -Cool set bonuses for weak armor/vanity sets, such as Eskimo, Pharaoh, Obsidian, Gladiator etc.
 -Faster Extractinator
 -Some items are renamed (Cobalt Shield => Guardian's Shield, Sandstone Slab => Sand Slab)
 -Autoswing for Night's Edge, True Night's Edge and True Excalibur
And some other things! Visit the mod's homepage for the full list.

NOTE: Since the 2.0 update you can now disable/enable features as you wish! Visit the mod's homepage for more info.
Install Flashkirby's Mod Settings Configurator to change them in-game.
